# Merry Christmas Everyone!
And a Happy New Year! üçª Cheers to the end of 2022 and start of 2023! Today I would like to talk about everything that has been going on in my life for the past, what, like 2-3 months, and what are my goals for the new year!

## Where have I been?
First off, I would like to talk about the thing that every high schooler fears, ***finals***. I was doing finals for over a week and it was **very** stressful, so I had no time to create a blog post, or really anything! Anyways, the reason I haven't been active: finals. 

p.s. I've also been watching a lot of anime, specifically **Bocchi the Rock** (aka peak anime)

## What are some side projects?
I recently started the development of [SkyTracker](sky.nat3z.com), a beautiful and easy-to-use Hypixel Skyblock Auction House and Bazaar tracking website. Currently, we have a prod build out, but I wouldn't say that it's "production ready," *if you know what I mean.* Another side project that I was creating was rebuilding some old sites and showing the redesign to the owner; and that was also very fun. Along with that, I created AniSync! An extremely powerful and helpful anime list tool that allows sites and services to access and edit your anime list on MAL, AniList, or wherever! This is currently still in development, and I'm planning to make it public along with the full release of SkyTracker, as I'm deciding if using it as a login method is a good idea or not. Other than that, I made a Hypixel Skyblock Frag running Bot in like, what, 30 minutes? (Wouldn't really consider that to be a side project though.)

**Oh yeah, if you haven't noticed yet, the domain changed from \*.github.io to nat3z.com! This is because I was gifted a domain and I'm very happy for it üòä**

## What are my 2022 goals?
Probably one of the major things I want to do in 2022 is create a stable release of SkyTracker and also release AniSync with it as well.

Thank you for reading my long, long, catch up and I hope everyone reading is having a great holiday season ‚ù§Ô∏è
