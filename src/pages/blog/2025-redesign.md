Hello there! I'm Nat3z, and I'm redesigning my website again! This time we're going back to the basics. I'm using Astro and TailwindCSS.

## Why the redesign?

I had a stroke of inspiration to redesign my website again. I personally really liked the design of my website from 2022,
but I wanted to make it more fitting for my personality, and what I love. I'm a big fan of VOCALOID, nerdy retro sites, the whole aesthetic
of neocities and the like, so I decided to make a website that is a mix of all of that. A mix of the old and the new that I can be proud of.

## What's new?

On the backend side of things, nothing has changed. I'm still using Astro and TailwindCSS. I decided to remove the Svelte component system,
since it added unnecessary complexity to the project. Markdown is still used for the blog posts, with all code still being
[source available](https://github.com/nat3z/nat3z.github.io). Additionally, I decided to do something funny: I used a Google Spreadsheet to store my personal data, and then used a Google Script to fetch the data and display it on my site. This will keep stuff like my interests, dni, and playlist
up to date, and will also allow me to easily update the data without having to change the code. I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a fun experiment.

To prevent insane load times every instance you open the site, I'm using Vercel's [ISR](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/isr) feature. This will cache the site for 1 hour, and then update it every hour. This will keep the site fast and responsive, and will also prevent the site from being slow when you open it.

As said before, the entire site was redesigned from the ground up with the "old and new" aesthetic in mind. The pronouns.page is back, with a
dynamic twist where the pronouns on my site adapt to the pronouns on pronouns.page. I'm using the
[Analogue Font](https://github.com/AbFarid/analogue-os-font/releases) for the main font, with the Hatsune Miku color palette.

I won't lie, some of the code was generated using Claude Sonnet 4 on Cursor. I'm not ashamed to admit it, because it is simply a fact
that LLMs for code editing will take over the job market.

## What didn't I like about the old design?

Good question. I'm not sure if I'll be able to answer this, but I'll try my best.

I'm not a fan of the old design because of the blurriness and the lack of expressiveness in the design. I don't feel like my site
makes a huge impact on my brand or the user. Although sleek, it didn't feel like me. This redesign is geared towards my rediscovery
of myself, who I am, and what I love. I'm tired of being blank and empty. I want to be able to express myself, and this redesign is a step
in that direction.

## What's next?

Expect more chaos to come. I'm not sure what I'll do with the site, but I'm sure it'll be something interesting.
